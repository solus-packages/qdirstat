summary    : QDirStat is a graphical application to show where your disk space has gone and to help you to clean it up 
description: |
    graphical disk usage display with cleanup facilities
    QDirStat (Qt Directory Statistics) is a small utility program that sums
    up disk usage for directory trees, very much like the Unix 'du' command.
    It displays the disk space used up by a directory tree, both numerically
    and graphically.  It is network transparent (i.e., you can use it to sum
    up FTP servers), and comes with predefined and user configurable cleanup
    actions.
